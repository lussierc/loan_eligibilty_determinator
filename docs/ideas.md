For each of your five ideas, please respond to the following. Each person is to submit a markdown document containing the names of his or her group members.

Please be sure that you justify why your idea is of interest to discrete structures.

### Idea 1
#### 1) Explain your idea for a class project.
Idea 1 is that we would make a program that a company could use to manage it's clientele in terms of making decisions based on questions given to them. The program would allow the user to add clients and their responses to some specified questions. The program would then give a determination about what action to take based on the clients' responses. The program could also possibly allow the user to remove clients and their responses. Additionally, the program could also output the users information, responses, and the program's determination to a file. It could also read this file in to update it.

For example, our program could be made for a doctor's office. The program would allow the user to add clients and their responses to questions about possible illnesses. The program would then output a determination on whether or not the client should go to the doctor, based on the responses. The program could then save these responses in a document. Another example comes in the financial sphere of today's world, in the term of whether a client should buy a certain stock or not. Similarly to the last example, the program would ask clients questions, in this case about their financial well-being and the stock's recent trends. It would then use a truth table to give a determination about whether or not the client should buy the stock.

If completed this idea would be a good way to show the connection between the idea of the propositional logic truth tables of discrete mathematics, computer science concepts, and real-world/everyday applications of these ideas.
#### 2) How is the idea connected to computer science?
This idea is connected to computer science in a few ways. Mainly, to create this program we would have to use computer science concepts in order to create it. One of these concepts that can be found in Python is the concept of a truth table. Truth tables are a table of combinations of truths with connectives (logical operators). They define the truth value of every connective. Utilization of truth tables is how the program would complete it's task of coming out with a determination based on the client's responses to questions. Another concept that would be used is that of classes and objects. In computer science and Python, objects are usually containers for types of data. A class is an object constructor of sorts. The class could construct objects that are related to the inputted client answers. These concepts would be used to add client information into the program quickly and easily, relating to the project idea.

Overall, this project idea is connected to computer science because it exemplifies the ideas of computer decision making based on computer interaction.

#### 3) What is the article's reference to support this idea? Note: Articles are no older than five years
MLA:

#### 4) What is the central thesis to the article?
"IMRT QA is not a reasonable replacement for a credentialing phantom. Moreover, the particularly poor agreement between IMRT QA and the IROC Houston phantoms highlights surprising inconsistency in the QA process."

#### 5) How will this article support your idea?
This article supports our idea because it shows an example of a real-world use of the idea of truth tables, which is what our idea would attempt to show as it would be combining Python programming and truth tables to create programs for real-world uses (by businesses). In the case of this article, it shows an example of a real-world use of truth tables in the medical field. In the work done for this article, truth tables "were constructed to compare pass/fail results of IMMRT QA and the IROC Houston Phantom."

### Idea 2
#### 1) Explain your idea for a class project.
Another idea that we have for a class project would be to make a maze game of sorts using graphs and graph theory. The user would be given a maze and would have to input which way they want to go in order to try to exit it. If they are able to exit the maze, they win the game.

This idea is connected to the idea of discrete structures from graph theory. It would be a fun way to show the connection between graph theory in discrete structures, computer science, and games.

#### 2) How is the idea connected to computer science?
This idea is connected to connected to computer science because though Graph Theory is a discrete mathematics idea, it is heavily utilized in computer science. Additionally, to create this game we would have to code it in Python, which obviously is apart of the computer science sphere. We would have to use computer science concepts such as objects, classes, and more, to make this idea come to fruition.

#### 3) What is the article's reference to support this idea? Note: Articles are no older than five years
MLA Citation:
Mondal, Basudeb, and Kajal De. "Overview Applications of Graph Theory in Real Field." International Journal of Scientific Research in Computer Science, Engineering and Information Technology 2.5 (2017): 751-759.

Link: http://ijsrcseit.com/paper/CSEIT1725170.pdf
#### 4) What is the central thesis to the article?
"Various application of graph theory in the real field has been identified and represented along with what type of graphs are used in that application. The Authors tries to give a basic conceptual understanding of all such type of graphs."

#### 5) How will this article support your idea?
Our idea would be using graph theory to create a game. This article supports our idea because it helps to explain that graph theory has more real-world uses than just in discrete mathematics alone. The article shows that graph theory can be used in biochemistry, engineering, computer science, and more. This makes it seem more feasible that graph theory could be used to make our game.

### Idea 3
#### 1) Explain your idea for a class project.
Another idea we have for a project would be for a business tracking its workers with what hours they work. The way we could do this is have our program made up of lists that have stored the workers names into the program, then after that we could use a boolean truth table to track there work. For example if the worker is at work when they come in they would just type in there name and then type in true and after that it will count as them being logged into the work day and then when they leave then just type in false and it will sign them out.
#### 2) How is the idea connected to computer science?
This idea is connected to computer science because we would use either a list, dictionary, or tuple to store the person name and whether they are on the clock or not and then we could use a boolean truth table to return whether or not they are working right now or what there hours were for the given week.
#### 3) What is the article's reference to support this idea? Note: Articles are no older than five years
I got my idea from this page where they use a smart card to track whether or not students have been attending class. I thought of how at work there is usually a time card that is used or maybe an electronic device, and we could make it very simple to have a program running on a computer where everyone walks in and they just type true when they enter and false when they leave. the article supports this idea by saying it will help increase students going to class like in the workforce it would help to know whether or not a worker is working enough hours or maybe whether or not a worker deserves a raise with his time spent.

#### 4) What is the central thesis to the article?
Having a smart attendance card that you carry around and says whether your in class or not will not waste time on attendance and cause more kids to show up.
#### 5) How will this article support your idea?
Our idea is to create a sign in system for large companies with many workers where logs could get confusing and sometimes lost, this article supports it by saying it will help students, in our case workers, show up to work more often and maybe even for longer than normal.

### Idea 4
#### 1) Explain your idea for a class project.
For idea number 4 we could use graph theory to demonstrate traffic simulator. Using this simulator we can compare how  traffic in currently flows in the real world compared to how it can be improved and maximized so that people are driving around with peak efficiency. This idea can be scaled with a few data points or  thousands, provided their is enough memory. The end result of this project would be to achieve peak data traffic flow while the the traffic is dispersed equally among the road network. This program should also be able to handle sudden changes to the road system, where if a point is removed efficiency only decreases by a certain magnitude.
#### 2) How is the idea connected to computer science?
This idea is connected to computer science because we would use graph theory to create the road network. This network can either be based off an existing road system, which may work very well or currently is very inefficient, or we can create our own.  For the data sets of the cars we would most likely assign random license plate numbers to represent data points and as they travel through the network at each point they would stop and be added to the list, however the list would be of a fixed size to represent traffic congestion and the limit of efficiency. This program would use lists and graph Theory, combined with efficent programming to solve traffic problems.

#### 3) What is the article's reference to support this idea? Note: Articles are no older than five years
Gauthier, Pauline, et al. “Road Network Resilience: How to Identify Critical Links Subject to Day-to-Day Disruptions.” Transportation Research Record, Aug. 2018, doi:10.1177/0361198118792115.

Link: https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0361198118792115#articleCitationDownloadContainer
#### 4) What is the central thesis to the article?
By stress testing the simulation of a system with different factors such as topography, network congestion, and demand we can identify key network data, which could potentially lead to a more efficient design in the future.
#### 5) How will this article support your idea?
This article is exactly what our idea is based off on. For this idea we want to create a road network that can remain efficient under a number of factors, that include network demand and heavy congestion. We also want the data to be able to be evenly distributed throughout the system if possible to maintain balance between the networks. This article is very closely related to  this goal, but instead uses the word resilience to refer to all the aforementioned demands of the network.


### Idea 5
#### 1) Explain your idea for a class project.
