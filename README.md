# Loan Eligibility Determinator

## About This Project
This project, coded in Python, determines if a loan applicant is eligible for a loan based off answers to questions. There are two sets of questions, a fast-track set of 3 questions and a larger set of 7 more in-depth questions. Additionally, if the user is determined to be ineligible for the loan based on the fast-track questions, they can move into the in-depth. Based off of the user's inputted answers, the program uses truth tables and boolean logic/boolean equations to determine the applicant's eligibility.

### Objective
To learn more about coding with Python and create a project with potential real-world implications, use, and purpose.

## Running The Project's Code
First clone the project using the command `git clone git@github.com:lussierc/loan_eligibilty_determinator.git`. Then ensure Python3 is installed on your machine.

Navigate to the `src` directory in terminal.

Then run the command:
```
python3 loan_eligibility_determinator.py
```

## Results
Results and more information about this project and its potential uses can be found in the folder docs, with the major results coming inside of the file `report.md`. Results included the idea that a Loan Eligibility Determinator would be a good tool for banks and loan agencies to use to prevent costly bad loans. Additionally, the while the determinations made by the project seem to be on the right track, there is no questions that improvements could be made.
