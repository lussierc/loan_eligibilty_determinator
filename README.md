Designed for use with [GitHub Classroom](https://classroom.github.com/), this repository contains the starter files for Lab 5 in Computer Science 102.

## Introduction

This lab is to be completed in groups to find ideas and associated articles for a potential class project. See assignment sheet for details.

## Files

All your writing will go into the File, '''writing/ideas.md'''

## Learning

If you have not done so already, please read all of the relevant [GitHub Guides](https://guides.github.com/) that explain how to use many of the features that GitHub provides. In particular, please make sure that you have read the following GitHub guides: [Mastering Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/), [Hello World](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/), and [Documenting Your Projects on GitHub](https://guides.github.com/features/wikis/). Each of these guides will help you to understand how to use both [GitHub](http://github.com) and [GitHub Classroom](https://classroom.github.com/).

To do well on this assignment, you should also review class slides and read assigned Chapters of the course textbook and the relevant course slides. Please see the course instructor or one of the teaching assistants or tutors if you have questions about any of these reading assignments.

with either the course instructor or a teaching assistant during the practical
session. Alternatively, you may ask questions in the Slack team for this
course. Finally, you can schedule a meeting during the course instructor's
