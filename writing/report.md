## Report
In today's world, businesses must have good decision making if they want to have any hope of being financially successful. For a bank or loan agency, decision making when giving out loans is an essential task that can contribute to economic profit or disaster. Similarly, for the loan applicant, they should be judged fairly when getting a loan, regardless of economic class. For our project, we decided to create a Loan Eligibility Determinator program that could theoretically be used by a bank or loan agency when determining whether or not a loan applicant should be granted a loan. Created in Python, this program uses the ideas of truth tables and boolean logic to generate an eligibility determination based on the applicants' responses to one or both of two question sets. One question set, the "fast-track" question set, contains three questions. If the user answers "yes" to all three of these questions, they are automatically granted the loan. If they are determined to be ineligible for the loan after this round of questions, they are recommended to move on to a more in-depth question set containing 7 questions, all of which are weighted differently to determine applicant eligibility. The user can choose to use one or both question sets, which helps to save time and allow for a more fair process. The program contains a variety of features to enhance the user experience including a save feature, a feature that quickly restarts the program, and more. This Python project, utilizing truth tables and boolean logic, accurately determines a loan applicant's eligibility, something that is more important than ever for banks and loan agencies to be successful in today's financial climate.

There were a variety of motivating factors that contributed to our decision to create our Loan Eligibility Determinator. One of these motivations came from our group's interest in learning more about truth tables and boolean logic after learning about them in class and experimenting with them in a lab. After these experiences, we felt that truth tables and boolean logic could be used for a wide range of topics. With this in mind, we began to think of how we could use these Python and discrete structures concepts in conjunction with Economics since three of our group's members are minoring (or double-majoring) in Economics. Eventually, we decided to look into making a program that would calculate an applicant’s loan eligibility. This led us to do background research on the topic of loans and the information we found showed the importance of loans, only adding to our motivation to create a loan eligibility determinator. One researcher found that, "Bad loans have been identified as one of the major factors affecting the profitability and survival of rural and community banks in Ghana" (Amoako). Though this research was completed about banks Ghana, it is still relevant in terms of banks in more developed countries like the United States and for loan agencies. If a bank or loan agency gives out too many bad loans, the effects could be catastrophic, ranging from a simple loss of profit to a possible bankruptcy. Banks need to stop giving out bad loans in order to maximize their profits, a theory supported by Asantey, J. O., and S. Tengey who say that banks need to hedge against bad loans to maximize their financial performance. China has attempted to reduce potential financial risks from loans by establishing four asset management companies who are assigned the task of dealing with bad loans (Bonin, John P., and Yiping Huang). Some more research showed us that if a "loaner" and loan applicant have some sort of relationship, this could overwhelm a moral or reasonable working relationship between the two because of an emotional bond (Karagiannis, Stelios, Yannis Panagopoulos, and Aristotelis Spiliotis). This is important because if there is some sort of emotional bond between the two parties, bad loans could be given out because of emotions that could hurt the bank later on. This is a large motivating factor for our program because it determines the applicant's loan eligibility regardless of an emotional bond, which can help banks and loan agencies prevent bad loans, which will help their overall financial health. After some online research, idea generation, and group discussion we realized the potentially harmful effects bad loans can have on a banks financial health and settled on the idea of making a Python program that would determine loan eligibility using concepts learned in CS102.

Our team implemented code for this project that allowed for the successful completion of a Loan Eligibility determinator. We began by drawing our a simple diagram of what functions we thought should be created for the program and how they would interact. Basing our code off of this diagram, we created a variety of functions, the first of which is `start_up_message()`. This function is very simple as it only contains the print statements needed to print out the welcome message for the program that contains the program title and information about the program. There is also the `restart_program_menu()` function which when called allows the user to choose whether or not they want to restart the program or not. This code uses Python's `input` keyword to gather the user's decision and `if and else statements` to restart the program by calling the `main` function or close the program. Additionally, there is also the `save_file` function that allows the user to decide whether they want to save the applicants loan eligibility information to a `.txt` file. This function takes in the variables `applicant_name`, `eligibility_status_str`, and `question_set_status` so it can output this information to a text file. Similar to the `restart_program_menu()` function, this function uses the `input` keyword and `if and else statements` to perform the user's selected action based off of their input. If the user decides to save to a file, the user is prompted to enter a file name to save to (again, using the `input` keyword) and the `open` keyword is used to create (or open the file if it already exists) the file. The `write` keyword is then used to save the information to the file and the file is closed using the `closed` keyword. The next functions relate to the determination of the loan applicants' eligibility status. The first, `prelim_q_analyzer` contains the boolean equation used to calculate the applicant's loan eligibility status for the 3 fast-track questions. The second, `indepth_q_analyzer` contains the boolean equation used to calculate the applicant's eligibility status for the in-depth questions. Both of these functions take in the boolean answers from the user responses to the program's questions. The final function, `main()` is the "driver" function of the program, calling other functions and containing the bulk of the code for the project. Again, the program uses the `input` keyword to have the user enter the applicant name and `if and else statements` to allow the user to chooses whether they want to do the fast-track questions or in-depth questions. For each set of questions, the program uses the `input` keyword to gather the applicant's answers to questions and `if and else statements` to convert these answers to booleans that are stored in individual lists. The program then uses `for` statements to iterate through these boolean lists, using either the `prelim_q_analyzer` or `indepth_q_analyzer` to perform analysis on applicant question answers and give a determination. This determination is then printed to the user and they are asked if they want to save the program using the `save_file` function and if they want to restart the function using the `restart_program_menu`. Finally, outside of all of the functions the functions `start_up_message()` and `main()` are each called, allowing the program to run. By calling the `start_up_message()` and `main()` functions separately, the user does not have to see the startup message every time they restart the program. Our program was built using Python3 and should be run using Python3 for best results. Overall, by drawing a basic diagram before beginning coding and having good team communication, our team was able to create a Loan Eligibility Determinator.

Here is a simple flow diagram for our program's code:

After completing our program and testing it numerous times, we took a step back to view our results and analyze them. We tested our program for two main things. One was to make sure that everything was functioning properly, the other was to test the correctness and accurateness of the boolean equations being used to determine whether or not an applicant was eligible for a loan. By testing the program we were able to see that everything functioned well with no noticeable issues. When we took a step back to really analyze our own work in terms of the program's usability we found a few good things and a few bad things. We were able to see that the program ran smoothly, allowing users to enter "yes" or "no" for questions in uppercase or lowercase which helps to keep the program working smoothly and prevent user frustration. Additionally, the program allows the user to choose if they want to restart the program quickly after going through a question set, allowing the user to more quickly use the program and not have to restart it every time they want to use it. Also, our program allows the user to quickly save applicant eligibility statuses to a .txt file. Our group believes that this would be helpful for a user who wants to generate a loan eligibility determination for multiple applicants at one time. Despite these good aspects of program usability, there are a few things our group saw when analyzing our program that could be improved upon (if we had more time). One of these things our group did not have time to add would be to allow the user to automatically advance to the in-depth set of questions after receiving a "no" in terms of loan eligibility when completing the fast-track questions. This would have enhanced quick usability of the program. Additionally, our group felt we came up a little bit short when implementing the file save feature. We should have allowed the user to save to the same file over and over again without entering the file name every single time, however, we did not have time to implement this. The most important part of our analysis came when we were analyzing the results of our boolean equations that were determining an applicant's loan eligibility status. We gathered results by testing the program many times with both sets of questions, giving each set a multitude of different questions. We would then analyze the given result (the determination) by viewing the result in conjunction with the applicant responses to see if the eligibility result made sense based off of these answers. Overall, it seems that our boolean equations performed well in the area of weighting question importance. However, our group members agreed that if we had more time the equations could be more fine-tuned so that the results are more accurate based on user responses and question importance. After analyzing our program we believe that our program is fairly user-friendly and performs well but that it could use some more fine-tuning in the areas of user experience and eligibility result determination.

Here is what the program output looks like when saved in a `.txt` file using the `save_file()` function. This feature allows for a better user experience. This screenshot also shows a small portion of our results that were collected when testing the accuracy of the boolean equations.

The group members for this project worked in conjunction with one another and communicated often in order to complete this project. All the group members contributed when coming up with the concept for the project and drawing up a diagram about how the program should work and how its functions should work. All of the group members participated in the creation of the boolean equations and helped to come up with the questions whose answers were analyzed by these functions. Additionally, all the team members helped out in testing the boolean equations accuracy and program overall in order to provide a good user experience. In terms of the presentation, all of the group members worked together to create the slides and content included in the presentation. The group also split up at times in order to save time and reduce stress when completing the project. Christian completed much of the coding for this project, creating the welcome message, save feature, restart feature, and more. He also helped write code for the `main()` function and helped with the writing in terms of background research, idea generation, and the writing itself in terms of the proposal and report. Additionally, Mikey also helped with a lot of the coding, adding user convenience features, one of which allows the user to enter variations of accepted answers, to a variety of functions. Mikey also greatly contributed in terms of writing the report and helped out in a variety of other areas. Trent also contributed to some of the project's code, helping to add comments, fix errors, and he worked with other team members to implement new features and ideas to the project. He was also very helpful in completing background research for the program's questions and for the writing portions of the project. Robert was also helpful as he provided insight and ideas other group members had not thought of throughout the duration of the assignment. While all team members helped test the program, he was instrumental in testing the program's boolean equation. He also helped complete background research in a variety of areas for the project. Overall, the team performed well and did not have any disputes throughout the completion of this project.

Our Loan Eligibility Determinator program asks the user a series of questions about their financial standing to determine their eligibility to receive a loan. We were motivated to complete this project due to personal interest in the field of Economics and background research that showed the detrimental effects that bad loans can have on a bank's financial health. It contains a number of helpful features including a save feature that allows the user to save applicant eligibility to a file, a restart feature for convenient quick restarting of the program, allowance of multiple variations of words for user responses to enhance usability, and more. The results that we got from our program were quite positive because the program worked properly, efficiently, and was very comprehensible, contributing to a good user experience overall. Additionally, we found that our boolean equations that determined an applicant's loan eligibility status did a fairly good job of weighting question importance and applicant responses to give a fair determination. Despite these successful results, there were some shortcomings. The boolean equations could still be fine-tuned and some portions of the user experience still need improvement, such as the save file feature. We learned a variety of things while completing this project. For example, we learned the importance of loans in today's economic climate and how important giving out good loans are to a loan agencies success. From our project, we also found that the research to go into the questions asked is quite extensive because it needs to be able to relate to every social class and not favor of any one class. With this, one of the biggest challenges was getting the eligibility algorithm to work properly and have good accuracy in its judgment. Another big challenge our group encountered was saving the eligibility determination into a `.txt` file of the user's choice, but we were able to overcome this challenge by completing online research. These big challenges led to the biggest rewards as we felt some of the most rewarding portions of this assignment were getting both the determination algorithm and the file save to work properly and efficiently. Due to a variety of motivating factors, we decided to complete a Loan Eligibility Determinator that performed quite well, in part due to good teamwork, despite some of the challenges faced during its completion.
